dp-dataset-api
==================
A ONS API used to navigate datasets, editions and versions - which are published.

### Installation

#### Database
* Run `brew install mongo`
* Run `brew services start mongodb`

* Run `brew install neo4j`
* Configure neo4j, edit `/usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.2.0/libexec/conf/neo4j.conf`
* Set `dbms.security.auth_enabled=false`
* Run `brew services restart neo4j`

#### Getting started

* Run api auth stub, [see documentation](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-auth-api-stub)
* Run `make debug`

### State changes

Normal sequential order of states:

1. `created` (only on *instance*)
2. `submitted` (only on *instance*)
3. `completed` (only on *instance*)
4. `edition-confirmed` (only on *instance* - this will create an *edition* and *version*,
    in other words the *instance* will now be accessible by `version` endpoints).
    Also the dataset `next` sub-document will also get updated here and so will the *edition*
    (authorised users will see a different latest *version* link versus unauthorised users)
5. `associated` (only on *version*) - dataset `next` sub-document will be updated again and so will the *edition*
6. `published` (only on *version*) - both *edition* and *dataset* are updated - must not be changed

There is the possibility to **rollback** from `associated`  to `edition-confirmed`
where a PST user has attached the _version_ to the wrong collection and so not only does
the `collection_id` need to be updated with the new one (or removed altogether)
but the state will need to revert back to `edition-confirmed`.

Lastly, **skipping a state**: it is possibly to jump from `edition-confirmed` to `published`
as long as all the mandatory fields are there. There also might be a scenario whereby
the state can change from `created` to `completed`, missing out the step to `submitted`
due to race conditions, this is not expected to happen,
the path to get to `completed` is longer than the `submitted` one.

### Healthcheck

The endpoint `/healthcheck` checks the connection to the database and returns
one of:

- success (200, JSON "status": "OK")
- failure (500, JSON "status": "error").
